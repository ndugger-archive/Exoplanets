(WIP) Exoplanets

This visualization does not accurately depict each planet's location in the sky, relative to us. It does, however, depict their distance outward from our sun, their temperature (hot, warm, or cold), and their aproximated radius.

Each dashed line represents __ parsecs upon the initial page zoom. Using the scroll wheel on your mouse will change it, though the zoom value will change soon.

Clicking on a planet will bring up a box with their information. Style/UI will change soon as well. It's just a rough cut at the moment.
